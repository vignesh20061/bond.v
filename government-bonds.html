            <h2>What are Government Bonds?</h2>
            <p>
                Government bonds are debt instruments issued by the Government
                of India or State Governments to raise funds for public
                spending.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Government Bonds</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Government Securities (G-Secs)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Treasury Bills (T-Bills)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Savings Bonds</strong></li>
                <li><strong>State Development Loans (SDLs)</strong></li>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>
